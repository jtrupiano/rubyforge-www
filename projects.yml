  - name: timecop
    release: 0.2.1
    api_url: http://johntrupiano.rubyforge.org/timecop
    released: March 6, 2009
    source_url: http://github.com/jtrupiano/timecop
    description: A gem providing simple ways to mock Time.now, Date.today, and DateTime.now. It provides "time travel" and "time freezing" capabilities, making it dead simple to test time-dependent code.
  
  - name: timecop-console
    release: 0.1.0
    api_url: http://johntrupiano.rubyforge.org/timecop-console
    released: March 8, 2009
    source_url: http://github.com/jtrupiano/timecop-console
    description: timecop-console exposes controllers/routes for manipulating Time.now (using the Timecop gem) from your app. This is especially useful during development and QA, as you can very easily simulate the movement of time. Just as timecop gives you this ability within your tests, you can now easily make this available to your dev and QA team through a debug console. 
    
  - name: environmentalist
    release: 0.2.1
    api_url: http://johntrupiano.rubyforge.org/environmentalist
    released: March 6, 2009
    source_url: http://github.com/jtrupiano/environmentalist
    description: Provides an executable that converts a rails app‘s config structure. The basic idea is that environments themselves are now first-class citizens, allowing you to create several environments (e.g. staging, prodtest, demo, etc.) in a clean, organized fashion. Each environment is given its own folder where it can store its own set of configuration files (think mongrel configs, apache configs, etc.) without polluting the top-leve config/ directory.

    released: January 30, 2009
    source_url: http://github.com/jtrupiano/story-helper
    description: Provides very basic baseline for using direct Ruby to define your test data and test accessors. Still a work in progress, but something we use at SLS in lieu of fixtures. More details to come as this becomes more useful to others.
